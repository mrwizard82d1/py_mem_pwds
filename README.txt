MemorablePwds
=============

The MemorablePwds application generates passwords that are both strong
and yet easily memorized. These passwords are generated by randomly
selected two words from a large (20,159 entry) dictionary of English
words. (This dictionary provides approximately 14 bits of entropy for
each word - assuming that the random number generator is perfect.)
This generator separates these two words with a punctuation or digit
character. This provides an additional 5 bits of entropy (same
assumption). As a consequence, each password has approximately 33 bits
of entropy. This amount of entropy is not sufficient for very strong
passwords; however, these passwords can be used and, more importantly,
they can be *remembered* without necessarily writing them down.
